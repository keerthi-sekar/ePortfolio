Being able to voice opinions considering different perspectives is a strength I bring to a team dynamic.

                <p class="lead" style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 19px;">In my first rotation, I was able to take on various technical challenges building features for 3-4 projects in using C# and the Unity Engine. Having the opportunity to have the responsibility of 3-4 projects at once allowed me to learn how to juggle the business timeline and expectations with my technical programming knowledge. Getting the ability to work with artists and software developers in 1 cohesive team was what made me realize I love to work in a team with a diverse background. The biggest accomplishment from this rotation was I had the opportunity to complete a project from start to finish, releasing the application to the product with a culmination of what I learned from my first rotation. It was rewarding to see an whiteboard of ideas come to life in an a VR application on tethered headsets and the Oculus Quest.<br><br>In my second rotation, I was able to get more responsibility and find different ways to gain revenue for the company by taking part in translating VR functionality to Unity WebGL. Through this, I was able learn how to gather the needs of the clients and present technical information to help assist in making the new transition. In this process, I created flat demos in Unity WebGL to market the benefits of this new route. In result, I helped get a big project for the team and ultimately complete it for the client on a tight deadline.&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="lead" style="font-size: 16px;height: 354px;">My job as president is to look at the project in a systems perspective and make sure the propulsion system, hardware, and software cohesively connect together. Through this challenge, I conduct recurring Technical Design Reviews to make sure we meet our system requirements in every iteration of the design process. I also oversee communications and paperwork for the organization with our college campus and help bring in sponsors for our project. This role has allowed me to grow my knowledge in the business and technical area. It has also showed me how to balance innovative thinking with reasonable budgets and timelines based on the team's skills and available manpower. Designs have to acknowledge nontechnical constraints in order to be successful.</p>

                <p class="lead" style="font-size: 16px;height: 169px;">Before taking on the role of President, I oversaw the Electronics subteam, ensuring we have constant communication with other subteams and oversee the hardware and software portions of the project. The biggest lesson I learned from this role was the ability to find resources and people to help you solve the toughest design problems.</p>

                <p class="lead" style="font-size: 16px;height: 348px;">This job helped me gather a unique skillset of motivational interviewing. In this job, I was trained to help students from various backgrounds (first time college students, nontraditional college students, students who struggle with studying, etc.). Using motivational interviewing allowed me to help students learn about their strengths and weaknesses and cultivate various habits to be better students. Using my problem solving and debugging methods I learned through my engineering classes helped me find the underlying problems/habits students struggled with to help find personalized solutions based on their needs and situation.</p>
